# Virtual Theme Park Simulator

## Project Description

The Virtual Theme Park Simulator is a simulation software that allows users to design, manage, and observe a virtual theme park. The simulation includes various interconnected elements such as rides, attractions, visitors, staff, and facilities, all of which interact in real-time.

## Key Features

1. **Park Layout Design and Customization**: Users can design the layout of their park, placing rides, attractions, paths, and facilities. They can also customize the theme of different areas (e.g., fantasy land, futuristic zone).

2. **Ride and Attraction Management**: Users can add, remove, and upgrade rides and attractions. Each ride has attributes like capacity, duration, thrill level, and maintenance requirements.

3. **Visitor Behavior Simulation**: Virtual visitors enter the park with individual preferences, energy levels, and budgets. They make decisions about which rides to go on, when to eat, and other activities based on their preferences and current park conditions.

4. **Staff Scheduling and Management**: Users must hire and schedule various types of staff (ride operators, cleaners, entertainers, etc.). Staff performance affects park operations and visitor satisfaction.

5. **Queue and Capacity Management**: The simulator models queue formation at popular rides. Users can implement strategies like fast passes or virtual queuing systems to manage visitor flow.

6. **Weather Effects on Park Operations**: Simulated weather patterns affect visitor behavior and ride operations. Users must adapt to weather changes (e.g., closing outdoor rides during rain).

7. **Financial Tracking and Reporting**: The simulator tracks income (ticket sales, in-park purchases) and expenses (staff wages, maintenance costs). Users can view reports and analytics to inform their management decisions.

## OOP Concepts Application

The Virtual Theme Park Simulator utilizes various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to design and implement the simulation:

1. **Classes**: The project includes classes such as `Ride`, `Visitor`, `Staff`, `Facility`, and `Attraction` to represent the different entities in the theme park.

2. **Inheritance**: Different types of rides and attractions inherit from base `Ride` and `Attraction` classes, respectively, to model their specialized characteristics.

3. **Polymorphism**: Visitor preferences and behaviors are implemented using polymorphic methods, allowing for different decision-making processes based on the visitor type (e.g., thrill-seeker, family-oriented).

4. **Encapsulation**: The internal workings of ride operations and maintenance are encapsulated within the `Ride` class, exposing only the necessary methods for external use.

5. **Abstract Classes**: The `ParkEntity` class serves as an abstract base class, providing common attributes and methods for the various park elements.

6. **Static Members**: Park-wide statistics and global settings are implemented as static members of the `Park` class, allowing for easy access and management.

## Project Goals

The Virtual Theme Park Simulator aims to provide an engaging and realistic simulation experience for users, allowing them to design, manage, and observe a virtual theme park. Through the application of OOP concepts, the project aims to create a scalable and maintainable codebase that can be easily extended with new features and functionalities.
